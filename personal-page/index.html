        <h2>Hello! I'm DiAndre' Nelson</h2>
          <p>I am a software developer currently living in Saint Marys, Georgia.</p>
          <p>As a former US Navy 'Nuke', being well-rounded and knowledgeable in other disciplines was paramount to mission success.
             This has allowed me to develop into a software developer that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Delivers top-notch web designs</li>
              <li>Produces skillful and concise coding</li>
              <li>Thrives in collaborative settings</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>About DiAndre'</h2>
          <p>I crave learning new things. I initially had aspirations to be a doctor specializing in emergency medicine, and graduated in 2010 with 
             a BS in Biochemistry. Medical school wasn't in the cards for me, and I eventually found myself traveling the world in the military as a 
             nuclear electrician. The conclusion of that journey birthed a rekindled highschool interest into coding.</p>
          <p>My insatiable crave to learning has brought me to enroll into Thinkful's software engineering boot camp, focusing my coding interest into
             a rewarding career!</p>
          <p>In my spare time, I love to play sports (basketball and soccer are my favorites) and console video games with friends.</p>
